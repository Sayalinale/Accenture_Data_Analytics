# Content Performance Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze user reactions to different content categories by merging datasets and applying data analytics techniques. **Data preparation and cleaning were performed in Excel**, and analysis was conducted in Python using Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses three datasets:  
- **Reactions Table:** User reactions to content (likes, dislikes, etc.).  
- **Content Table:** Metadata about the content (title, category, etc.).  
- **Reaction Types Table:** Types of reactions recorded.  

## 🔄 Process  
1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning (Excel)**  
   - Merged datasets using VLOOKUP.  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized categories.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**  
   - Identified trends, engagement patterns, and reaction distributions.  
3. **Visualization & Insights (Python - Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
   - Created bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.  
4. **Key Findings & Recommendations**  
   - Provided data-driven content strategy improvements.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
✅ **Technology Leads (35%+ Engagement)** → Expand tech-related content.  
⚠️ **Finance Has High Negative Reactions** → Improve clarity & user experience.  
📚 **Education Shows Inconsistent Scores** → Standardize content quality.  
🔎 **Health & Lifestyle Have Hidden Opportunities** → Replicate successful content styles.  
📊 **80/20 Rule Applies** → Focus on **high-impact content** over quantity.
